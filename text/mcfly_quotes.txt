Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean? 
Ah, this, this is a radiation suit. 
Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born. 
Yeah, well, history is gonna change. 
If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. 
"Too loud." I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. 
Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. 
Yeah, I know. I know. "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything." 
All right, okay, Jennifer. What if I send in the tape in and they don't like it? What if they say I'm no good? What if they say, "Get out of here kid. You've got no future"? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man. 
No, get out of town. My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Look, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going out with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun. 
What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say, "Get outta here, kid. You got no future"? I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man! 
Ah, yeah. Give me- Give me a Tab. 
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free. 
That's right! He's gonna be mayor. 
No, wait, Doc. Doc. The-the-the bruise on your head, I know how that happened. You told me the whole story. You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell and you hit your head on the sink. And that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which is what makes time travel possible. 
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me? 
Whoa. This is heavy. 
This is heavy. 
Um, plutonium. Wait a minute. Are... 
Are you telling me that this sucker is NUCLEAR? 
Doc, you don't just walk into a store and-and buy plutonium! Did you rip that off? 
Hey, come on. I had to change. Do you think I'm going back in that-that zoot suit? The old man really came through. It worked! 
He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life! 
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88. 
But the car, Dad. I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad. I mean, do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue? 
You'll find out. 
Whoa. They really cleaned this place up. Looks brand-new. 
Sounds pretty heavy. 
Yeah, it's 8:00. 
Wait a minute - wait a minute, Doc... are you telling me that it's 8:25? 
Damn! I'm late for school! 
Do you know where Riverside Drive is? 
A block past Maple? That's, uh, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. 
You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. 
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. 
We're the, uh... We're the Pinheads. 
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey? 
Yes, definitely. Goddamn it, George, swear. 
HOLY SHIT! 
Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein! 
Look, Marvin, you gotta play. See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance. If they can't dance, they can't kiss. If they can't kiss they can't fall in love, and I'm history. 
I g-guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. 
That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? 
Calvin? Wh... Why do you keep calling me Calvin? 
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike! 
Of course! The Enchantment Under the Sea dance! They're supposed to go to this. That's where they kiss for the first time. 
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink. 
Because you... You might regret it later in life. 
Mom. That you? 
I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible. 
Wh-what? You mean like a date? 
What kind of date? I don't know. What do kids do in the '50s? 
Nothing. 
Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right. 
I guarantee it. 
Well, yeah. You know we have... two of them. 
Where are my pants? 
Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future? 
Lorraine. Have you ever been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way, but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? 
You do? What? 
Believe me, it makes perfect sense. 
Hey. What the hell is this? 
Doc, do you have a 75-ohm matching transformer? 
It's a hair dryer. 
Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future? 
I'm really gonna miss *you*. 
Doc, about the future... 
Look, you're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad... Dad-Dad-Daddy-O. 
Let's go over the plan again, so eight-thirty where are you going to be? 
And where am I gonna be? 
Right, so right around nine o'clock she's going to get very angry with me. 
No, no, no listen, George it's just an act! Okay? So around nine o'clock you're walking through the parking lot, you see us... struggling in the car. You walk up, you open the door and you say ... your line, George! 
He's a Peeping Tom! 
He laid out Biff in one punch. I didn't know he had it in him. He's never stood up to Biff in his life! 
I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985. 
My name is Lord Vader. I am an Extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan. 
Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school. What have you been doing all day? 
Alright, okay, listen, keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe. 
What made you change your mind, George? 
Yeah, well, uh, let's keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay? 
Listen, you got a back door to this place? 
Right, right. I have a real problem with that. 
I know, Doc. But I had to come. 
Yeah, right. When? High noon? 
Eight o'clock. I do my killin' after breakfast! 
Hey, Doc! Where you goin' now? Back to the future? 
What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan. 
You're Mad Dog Tannen! 
Great Scott! 
I'm sorry, Doc. It's all my fault you're stuck back there. I never should have let Biff get to me! 
Uh, Mar- Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. 
Holy shit, Doc! Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher. They say she fell in there a hundred years ago. 
Every kid in school knows that story 'cause we all have teachers we'd like to see fall into that ravine. 
So you're my great-grandfather. The first McFly born in America. And you peed on me. 
How many did he have? 
Just the one? Come on, Doc! 
I had this horrible nightmare. Dreamed I w-... dreamed I was in a western. And I was being chased by all these Indians... and a bear. 
McFly farm? Why, you're my, you're my, my... who are you? 
Wait a minute, Doc. If I drive straight towards the screen, I'm gonna crash into those Indians. 
You mean the past? 
Uhhhhh... Indians! 
Aw, look, pal. I don't wanna buy a suit. 
You mean the past. 
Doc! Doc! Come here quick! 
You're not far off, Doc. 
Uh, I'll have an... ice water. 
I know, Doc, it's beautiful. 
Hey, lighten up, jerk! 
Do you think it's possible to get it up to... 90? 
Look, Doc, what's the worst that can happen, huh? So they don't name the ravine after her. Let's just get the DeLorean ready and get the hell out of here. 
Yeah. You think I was stupid enough to race that asshole? 
Alright, Doc. Look, as soon I get there, I'll put them on. I promise. 
Okay, relax, Doc, it's me! It's me, It's Marty! 
Oh, I know you did send me back to the future. But I'm back, I'm back *from* the future. 
This is heavy. 
You're the doc, Doc. 
Yeah, that's why you gotta come back with me. 
Back to the future. 
Bartender says that's the strongest stuff they got. 
A month? Doc, you're gonna get shot on Monday! 
Winter? Doc! Monday, it's three days away! 
Does it mention me? Am I one of the 12? 
My great-grandfather's name was William. 
Maybe it was just a mistake, Doc. Maybe that grave wasn't yours. There could've been another Emmett Brown back in 1885. 
Did you have relatives here back then? 
It's not gonna happen, Doc. After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean, I'm gonna go back to 1885 and I'm bringing you home. 
Doc, tomorrow morning, I'm going back to the future with you. But if Buford Tannen comes looking for trouble, I'm gonna be ready for him. You heard what that son of a bitch called me last night. 
What? What about my future? 
Wait a minute, Doc. What is wrong with my future? 
Right, Doc, but according to this map, there is no bridge. 
Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea. I mean, we can't wait around a year and a half for this thing to get finished. 
What about the locomotive? 
Seamus, relax, I know what I'm doin'. 
Wait a minute, you have a brother named Martin McFly? 
What are you talkin' about, Doc? 
Oh, man. Doc, we don't belong here! Neither one of us! You know, it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow! 
This tombstone could still be in your future! 
Doc, you're a scientist. 
So you tell me: What's the right thing to do? 
Wow, that worked great. 
C'mon, Doc. I mean, think about it. What are you gonna say to her? "I gotta go back to the future"? I mean, she's not gonna understand that, Doc. Hell, I'm in it with you and even I don't understand it. 
Doc. Listen, maybe we could - I don't know. Maybe we could just take Clara with us. 
Aw, come on, Doc, it's not science! When it happens, it just hits you. It's like lightning! 
There he is, Doc! Let's land on him, we'll cripple his car. 
No, I know; you *did* send me back to the future. But I'm back - I'm back *from* the future. 
Doc! Doc! Doc! Oh, fantastic. 
That's right, Doc. November 12, 1955. 
Mr. Strickland! Mr. Strickland. It- it- it's me, sir. It's Marty! 
Yeah! That's right! That's right, I am a slacker! Don't you remember, you gave me detention last week! 
What about the police, Biff? They're gonna match up the bullet with that gun. 
You son of a... 
Nice shot Doc! You're not gonna believe this, we gotta go back to 1955. 
Where are we? When are we? 
2015? You mean we're in the future? 
Uh, Jennifer, um, I don't know how to tell you this, but I... you're in a time machine. 
The almanac. Son of a bitch stole my idea! He must have been listening when I- It's my fault! The whole thing is my fault. If I hadn't bought that damn book, none of this would have ever happened. 
You mean the future. 
I don't get it, Doc. I mean, how can all this be happening? It's like we're in Hell or something. 
I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible. 
27th floor? 
'Cubs win world series... against Miami'? 
I just meant that Miami- What did you just say? 
What if I don't? 
You mean, I'm gonna see where I live? I'm gonna see myself as an old man? 
Doc, what do you mean? 
Well, that's a relief. 
I don't remember bars bein' on these windows... 
Mom, I just wanna know one thing. Where's my father? Where's George McFly? 
Tough break, kid. Must be rough bein' named after a complete butthead. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly! Think! Your old man, Mr. Loser? 
Look, I-I happen to know George McFly is not a loser... 
I did? I - I mean - I mean he did? 
The answer's no, Griff. 
Yeah, what are you deaf and stupid? I said "NO!" 
There's only one man who can help me. 
Are you two related? 
What do you mean "Time Circuits on"? Doc, we're not goin' back now! 
Doc, What about Jennifer? What about Einstein? We can't just leave 'em here. 
Doc... what if we don't succeed? 
You don't have to remind me of that, Doc. 
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, guys, hey, hey, hey guys! All I want is a Pepsi. 
Jennifer! Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes; let me look at you. 
Tell me about my future. I know I make it big, but do I become, like, a rich rock star? 
Okay, everybody let's back up now, huh? Let's back up... let's everybody back up, give him a little bit of room, okay? A little bit of air. It's okay, I know CPR. 
I know CPR. 
Nobody calls me chicken. 
What did you just call me? 
Nobody! Calls me... chicken. 
The future. Unbelievable. I gotta check this out, Doc. 
Tell me about my future. I know I make it big, but do I become like a rich rock star or something? 
Right, right. But I am rich, right? 
I don't get it, I thought you said this has something to do with my kids. 
Hey, look, a fellow skater! Ever used a hoverboard, pal? 
If you're into retro stuff, we should take a quick drive in Doc's DeLorean! 
What happens to us in the future, Doc? 
What do you mean? 
That's actually not a big deal for me. 
Yeah, I mean what's-what's wrong with that? 
I don't think I'm comfortable around you anymore. 
Too late, Doc.
